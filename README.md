# mehshell

A fast, parallelized prompt engine for zsh written in Go.

## Prompt Example

```text
╭─  ~/project  main ✓  v22.11.0                  ⎈ minikube  3s  04:20:47 PM
╰─❯
```

## Features

- Single Go binary, ~6ms per prompt.
- All segments run as parallel goroutines.
- Git dirty check with 150ms timeout. It never blocks, even in huge repos.
- Zero-fork git branch detection. It reads .git/HEAD directly.
- OS icon auto-detection for Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, NixOS, and macOS.
- Runtime version detection for Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, and Java when marker files are present.
- Cloud context support for Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, and GCP profiles.
- Terraform workspace and Docker context detection.
- Environment detection for Conda and virtualenv.
- Battery level with charge state icons.
- Command duration (3s+), time, and exit code coloring.
- Vi mode indicator (swaps prompt char on keymap change).
- Transient prompt (collapses previous prompt on Enter).
- Instant prompt (caches last prompt for zero-latency shell startup).
- Right-aligned segments on the first line.
- Nerd Font icons.
- Configurable via `~/.config/mehshell/config`.

### From source

```bash
go install github.com/blackflame007/mehshell@latest
```

## Zsh Integration

Add this to your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
eval "$(mehshell init zsh)"
```

## Configuration

Generate a default config file:

```bash
mehshell config init
```

This creates `~/.config/mehshell/config` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mehshell/config`). See [config.example](config.example) for the full default config.

### Features

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `transient_prompt` | `true` | Collapse previous prompts to `❯` on Enter. Set `false` to preserve full prompts with timestamps in scrollback. |
| `instant_prompt` | `true` | Show cached prompt immediately on shell startup. |
| `vi_mode` | `true` | Swap prompt character on vi keymap change (`❯`/`❮`). |

### Left Segments

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `os` | `true` | OS icon (Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, NixOS, macOS). |
| `dir` | `true` | Current working directory. |
| `git` | `true` | Git branch and dirty state (`✓`, `+`, `!`, `?`). |
| `node` | `true` | Node.js version when `package.json` is present. |
| `python` | `true` | Python version when marker files are found. |
| `go` | `true` | Go version from `go.mod`. |

### Right Segments

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `conda` | `true` | Conda environment name (skips `base`). |
| `venv` | `true` | Python virtualenv name. |
| `k8s` | `true` | Kubernetes context when manifest files are in cwd. |
| `terraform` | `true` | Terraform version when `.tf` files are present. |
| `docker` | `true` | Docker context when Dockerfile/compose is present. |
| `aws` | `true` | AWS profile from `$AWS_PROFILE`. |
| `azure` | `true` | Azure resource group from `$AZURE_DEFAULTS_GROUP`. |

| `battery` | `true` | Battery level with charge state icon. |
| `duration` | `true` | Command duration (shown when ≥ 3s). |
| `time` | `true` | Current time. |

Set any option to `false` to disable it. After editing, restart your shell or run:

```bash
source <(mehshell init zsh)
```

To see where your config lives:

```bash

## Benchmarks

| Metric | p10k | mehshell |
|---|---|---|
| Shell startup | 870ms+ | 64ms |
| Between commands | 6000ms (with vcs_info) | 28ms |
| Prompt generation | ~45ms | 6ms |

## Feature Comparison with Powerlevel10k

mehshell is intentionally minimal. p10k is a full-featured theme engine. Pick the right tool for your workflow.

| Feature | mehshell | p10k |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Single Go binary | Zsh scripts + gitstatusd daemon |
| **Dependencies** | Zero (Go stdlib only) | gitstatus binary (downloaded) |
| **Prompt generation** | ~6ms | ~45ms |
| **Shell startup impact** | ~64ms | ~870ms+ |
| **Configuration** | `~/.config/mehshell/config` | `~/.p10k.zsh` + config wizard |
| **Async rendering** | Goroutines (parallel) | Zsh workers + gitstatusd |
| **Git branch detection** | Zero-fork (reads `.git/HEAD`) | gitstatusd (libgit2) |
| **Git dirty check** | `git status` with 150ms timeout | Async, never blocks |
| **Instant prompt** | ✓ (cache-based) | ✓ |
| **Transient prompt** | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Vi mode** | ✓ (prompt char swap) | ✓ (full indicator) |
| **Custom segments** | Add in source | Public API (`p10k segment`) |
| **Total segments** | 20 | 67+ |

### Segment Coverage

| Segment | mehshell | p10k |

| Azure | ✓ | ✓ |
| GCP | ✓ | ✓ |
| Battery | ✓ | ✓ |
| Duration | ✓ | ✓ |
| Time | ✓ | ✓ (+ date) |
| CPU / RAM | — | ✓ |
| Vi mode | ✓ (prompt char) | ✓ (full indicator) |
